Assignment #6 for CPSC2108 [Data Structures]

This assignment was to help familiarize us with the behavior of binary search trees by measuring a tree's size, height and insertion time as the number of items to insert in the tree increased.  

BinaryTree.java and SearchTree.java are code provided with our assigned textbook, Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java by Koffman and Wolfgang.  BinarySearchTree.java, also provided by our course textbook, has been modified at the end to to included the required methods.
